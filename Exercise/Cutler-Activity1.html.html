<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><i><b>Daniel Cutler</b></i> is a student at UNC Charlotte. I am currently studing for a bachelor in Computer Science with a Concentetration in Cyber Security and a minor in Math. </p>

<p><i><b> Daniel Cutler</b></i> chose this class due to the class being <em>required for my major</em> but I plan to learn about Web Development and hope to use the knowledge I get from this class in the future. I expect there to be a learning curve with javascript and html but I am excited to learn new things.  </p>
